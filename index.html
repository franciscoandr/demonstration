            <h2>Software<a href="#"><sup>1</sup><img id="img1" src="img/software-catalog.jpg" /></a>, an exhibition by Jack Burnham</h2><br>
            <p>“Visitors were invited to do something extremely stranger: operate computers<a href="#"><sup>2</sup><img id="img2" src="img/exhibition1.jpg" /></a>”</p>
            <p>“The exhibit introduced artists to an important dimension of computing”</p>
            <p>“The exhibition wasn’t about getting artists and technologists together,<br> or about using new technologies for artistic purposes. Burnham wrote in the<br> catalog that, rather, “the goal of Software is to focus our sensibilities<br> on the fastest growing area in this culture: information processing<br> systems and their devices. “</p>
            <p>“The focus was generally on a finished product produced with computer tools”</p>
            <p>“The show caused a financial crisis for the museum(...)”</p><br><br>
            <h2>Augmenting Human Intellect Center<a href="#"><sup>3</sup><img id="img3" src="img/arc1.jpg" /></a> by Douglas Engelart</h2>
            <br>
            <p>“Demonstrations have had an important, perhaps even central, place in new <br>media innovation.”</p>
            <p>“They took the risk because they believed in the power of the system they were<br> planning to show, and thought only a live demonstration could convince <br>the computing mainstream of the importance of their research.”</p>
            <p>“This paper describes a multisponsor research center at Stanford Research Institute<br> in man-computer interaction.“</p>
            <p>“In the Augmented Human Intellect (AHI) Research Center at Stanford Research Institute<br> a group of researchers is developing an experimental laboratory around an interactive,<br> multi-console computer-display system, and is working to learn the principles by which<br> interactive computer aids can augment their intellectual capability.”</p>
            <p>“The research objective is to develop principles  and techniques for designing<br> an “augmentation system””</p><br><br><br>
            <p id="mine"><i>The Fall Joint Computer Conference</i>, which took place in 1968, which set Douglas Engelbart on stage<br> to talk about computer demonstrations as well as research carried out at the Augmented Research <br>Center (ARC), links easily with the <i>Software</i> exhibition. , Which took place in 1970, and was created<br> by Jack Burnham, who put his visitors in interaction with computers. The demonstrations mentioned<br> by Engelbart are represented here through the public interaction with the machines.</p>
